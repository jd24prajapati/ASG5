This program will store the alphabet and it's equvivalant morse code to the same node in a binary tree.
All the alphabets and it's code are reading from a text file namely, Morse_code.txt

Once, binary tree is being generated, user will be ask to enter a message to encode it. All lower case input will be automaticaly converted to upper case.

The same message will be encoded and then will be display at the console.
The same encoded message will be decoded with the same binary tree and decoded message will be display at the console.


Example:<br>
Enter a message :HELLO WORLD<br>
Coded message :**.... . .-.. .-.. ---  .-- --- .-. .-.. -..**<br>
Decoded message : **HELLO WORLD**<br>
